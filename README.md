## Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes internet usage patterns across different age groups, focusing on how people spend their screen time. The goal of this project is to clearly visualize the statistical differences between age demographics and provide a foundation for drawing conclusions about screen time behavior and usage trends

This dashboard is designed as a beginner-level Power BI project, emphasizing clean visuals and easy-to-understand insights

## Objectives

Compare total screen time across age groups

Break down screen time by usage category (e.g., entertainment, social media, work/study)

Analyze work/study screen time by age

Display average screen time metrics for each age group

Segment primary device and internet type based on age

Practice basic Power BI skills such as filtering, aggregation, and visual storytelling

## Tools Used

Power BI Desktop

Basic DAX measures (SUM, AVERAGE)

Simple data modeling and transformations

## Key Insights

Average total screen time remains largely consistent across all age groups, with only minor variation

How screen time is distributed across categories is also consistent across age groups

The younger age group (13-18yrs) and two oldest age groups (46-60yrs, 60+yrs) tend to use a tablet as their primary device while laptops and mobile devices were utilized more within the middle age ranges.

Category-level breakdowns provide more insight than total averages alone when comparing age demographics

## Future Improvements

Add trend comparisons or benchmarks

Enhance visuals with tooltips and drill-through pages

## Notes

The entirety of this data was collected in 2024, spanning all 12 months

This project is intended for learning and portfolio purposes and demonstrates foundational Power BI dashboard design and analysis techniques.
